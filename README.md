# void-jira-Python-REST
A repo with Python REST API scripts for Jira Server & Data Center

# Usage Guide
In order to be able to use these Python scripts there are some steps needed as pre-condition:  
1. First make sure that you have Python v.3+ installed on your computer  
   you can check via CMD (command prompt) with ```py -V```  
   if you cannot find any version of Python on your pc, make sure you install it  
2. Make sure that you have "pip" installed & upgraded  
   you can directly write via CMD ```py -m pip install --upgrade pip```  
   you can also check the version of pip with ```py -m pip --version```  
3. Ensure that you have setuptools and wheel up to date  
   run via CMD ```py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel```  
   you should see a confirmation that tools & wheel have been installed/upgraded  
4. The last step is to install atlassian-python-api  
   run via CMD ```py -m pip install atlassian-python-api```  
   you should see a lot of download & successful installation messages  

:exclamation: Make sure that you add the "atlassian-python-api" package to your IDE in order to run the scripts   
I personally use PyCharm, adding the package you installed at step 5 is eazy:  
  * Go to File -> Settings -> find "Project: pythonProject"  
    -> select Python Interpreter  -> on the right side window pree the plus icon ":heavy_plus_sign:"  
    -> search for ```atlassian-python-api``` -> click on it and press "Install Package" :white_check_mark:
